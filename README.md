# StatisticsAnalysis — Business Analytics Dashboard

> **Status:** Source-reviewed documentation draft. Runtime startup, end-to-end tests and screenshots have **not** been independently verified. Review PR before merging.

A dashboard with a React/Vite analytics frontend and ASP.NET Core backend. Source includes KPIs, revenue, expense, cash-flow and receivable/payable charts.

## Repository map

- `statisticsWeb/` — React/TypeScript dashboard.
- `statisticsBackend/StatisticsBackend/` — .NET API and data access.

## Technology

React, TypeScript, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Recharts, ASP.NET Core.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Install the runtime and tools relevant to this project (Node.js/npm, Python, .NET SDK, mobile SDK, or desktop runtime). Use the package manifest and lockfile to determine exact compatible versions. Obtain required databases and API credentials from your own provider accounts; never commit secrets.

### Install and run

**Frontend:** `cd statisticsWeb && npm ci && npm run dev`.

**Backend:** `cd statisticsBackend/StatisticsBackend && dotnet restore && dotnet run`. Configure the database connection using local secrets before starting.

> These commands are derived from repository manifests, not confirmed by an end-to-end launch. If startup fails, inspect the relevant service's environment variables, dependency versions and logs.

This is a **conceptual overview**, not a verified deployment topology. The directory map above identifies the actual code areas to inspect for detailed component boundaries.

## Validation and troubleshooting

1. Confirm compatible runtime versions and install dependencies using the checked-in lockfiles.
2. Supply local environment variables through ignored files or a secrets manager.
3. Start required database, queue, mobile emulator or API dependencies.
4. Run scripts declared in the package manifests; record exit codes and failing commands.
5. Verify a complete user workflow with **non-sensitive demo data**.
6. Capture screenshots only after successfully launching the real application.

If you see a connection error, verify service endpoints and credentials without printing secrets. If a native build fails, verify platform SDK versions and native dependencies. Never treat a successful dependency installation as proof that the app works.

## Screenshots

**Not captured yet.** Genuine screenshots will be added under `docs/screenshots/` only after launching the application. Each screenshot will include its screen name, purpose, relevant workflow, capture platform and verification status. Do not substitute generated mockups for runtime evidence.

## Security and maintenance notes

The frontend includes `mockData.ts`; distinguish demonstration data from live API results.

Review dependency advisories, license terms, authorization boundaries, sensitive files and third-party integrations before public deployment.

## Contributing

Open an issue with a reproducible description. Work on a feature branch, keep changes focused, update tests and docs, and request review through a pull request. Do not include credentials, customer data or personal information in issues or screenshots.
